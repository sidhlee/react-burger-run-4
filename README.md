# Burger Run 4

This is the 4th run of building burger-builder with react and redux.

## New in this run:

- Git init at the beginning of the project and commit continuously to github.
  1. Inside terminal, git init and git add .
  2. git commit -m "initial commit"
  3. git remote add origin "github-repo-uri"
  4. git push -u origin master.
  5. Go to extensions and search for @builtin git, enable them if not.
  6. VScode's version control menu will work now.
- Use vscode's version control. Learn workflow of:
  1. make changes
  2. stage changes and commit with message.
  3. push (to the github)
